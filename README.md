Analyzing death age difference of right handers with left handers
The Death Age Difference of Right-Handers with Left-Handers project aims to investigate the relationship between hand preference and lifespan. Specifically, the study will examine how the changing rates of left-handedness over time have affected the apparent mean age of death for left-handed individuals. The study will utilize data from a National Geographic survey conducted in 1986, which gathered information on age, sex, and hand preference for throwing and writing from over a million respondents.
The study will be conducted by analyzing the subgroup of individuals who throw left-handed but write right-handed, as this group is less likely to be influenced by changing social attitudes towards left-handedness. The rates of left-handedness for this subgroup will be plotted as a function of age, and the resulting distribution will be compared to the overall rates of left-handedness across different age groups.
The study's main hypothesis is that the changing rates of left-handedness over time will have an impact on the apparent mean age of death for left-handed individuals. By analyzing the data, the study aims to determine whether left-handed individuals have a different lifespan compared to right-handed individuals and whether this difference varies across different age groups.
Overall, the Death Age Difference of Right-Handers with Left-Handers project seeks to provide new insights into the relationship between hand preference and lifespan and to shed light on the impact of social attitudes on health outcomes.
